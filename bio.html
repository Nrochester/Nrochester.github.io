        Throughout my life in this country, I have always been interested in Tech. I was wowed by even what would be considered the most simplest form of technology. This was largely impacted by my upbringing. I came to the United States at a very young age from a 3rd world country that some of you may know, Jamaica. Most times when I inform someone that I was born in Jamaica, it is typically assumed that I was sitting under a palm tree, drinking coconut water without a care in the world. That couldn’t be any further from the truth. My family was very poor and had no idea about things outside of the countryside of Jamaica. When my family was able to move to this country, it was a blessing for us but we didn’t really understand how anything here worked. Funny story on how my passion for tech began, it was all because of an escalator. I actually freaked out my first time seeing an escalator because I had never seen the stairs move before and it frightened me. Even something as simple as that was so very interesting to me. I found all these new kinds of technology to be fascinating and I just had to figure out how everything worked. My mother was eventually able to purchase a PC and I was introduced to the internet. At that point, my inquisitive mind was in constant wonder. I wanted to learn all about how these unfamiliar things worked. To add on to my natural curiosity, I had to learn these things to help my mother as well. She had lived her entire life in Jamaica and was even more confused and perplexed than I was. Over time, I grew to love tech more and more and I came to realize that this was something that I wanted to do for the rest of my life.
